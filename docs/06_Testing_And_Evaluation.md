# Testing and Evaluation
Agents drift without tests.

A test pack should include
Happy path cases
Ambiguous cases that require selection
Missing knowledge cases
Out of scope cases
Adversarial cases that try to trigger guessing

Automatic fail conditions
Any invented fact presented as true
Any fabricated link or resource
Any write action without required selection
Any output that contradicts approved sources
