# Refusal and No Knowledge Patterns
Refusal and no knowledge are safety features.

No knowledge
Use when the agent cannot confirm the answer from approved sources.
The response should acknowledge the request, state the limitation, and ask for the minimum missing detail or provide the next safe step.

Refusal
Use when the request is out of scope, unsafe, or violates policy.
The response should be clear and brief, with a safer alternative when appropriate.

Never bluff
Do not claim you performed actions you cannot perform.
Do not claim knowledge you do not have.
