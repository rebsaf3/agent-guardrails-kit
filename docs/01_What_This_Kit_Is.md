# What This Kit Is
This kit is a set of reusable guardrails for business agents.

It is not a single agent.
It is a pattern you can apply to many agents so they behave consistently and safely.

The kit includes
Templates for agent instructions and tool contracts
Schemas for request envelopes and run logs
Standard response patterns for missing knowledge and missing selection
A test pack template to prevent drift
Change control templates for safe iteration
